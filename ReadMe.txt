<Data Collection>
Link of the dataset used:
https://www.kaggle.com/thespacefreak/taylor-swift-spotify-data

I have collected the Spotify dataset of Taylor Swift’s 9 major studio albums from Kaggle.com. The dataset consists of data from songs on Taylor Swift’s albums excluding concerts, studio sessions, and feature songs. Also, between the standard album and deluxe / Taylor’s versions of albums, the latter is considered. 

Hence, the 9 major studio albums are:
1.	Taylor Swift (2006)
2.	Fearless (Taylor's Version) (2021)
3.	Speak Now (Deluxe Package) (2010)
4.	Red (Deluxe Edition) (2012)
5.	1989 (Deluxe) (2014)
6.	reputation (2017)
7.	Lover (2019)
8.	folklore (deluxe version) (2020)
9.	evermore (deluxe version) (2020)

Regarding the quality of the data, the data is available on Kaggle, which is a well-known platform in the field of Data Science. Secondly, the dataset is new as it was updated a month ago. It was extracted using the Spotify WebAPI, using the spotipy Python library.

The dataset includes the following set of columns:
•	name - Name of song
•	album - Name of album
•	artist - Name of artist/s involved
•	release_date - Release date of album
•	length - Song length in milliseconds
•	popularity - Percent popularity of the song based on Spotify's algorithm (possibly the number of stream at a certain period of time)
•	danceability - How suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity
•	acousticness - How acoustic a song is
•	energy - A perceptual measure of intensity and activity
•	instrumentalness - The number of vocals in the song
•	liveness - Probability that the song was recorded with a live audience
•	loudness - Tendency of music to be recorded at steadily higher volumes
•	speechiness - Presence of spoken words in a track (if the speechiness of a song is above 0.66, it is probably made of spoken words, a score between 0.33 and 0.66 is a song that may contain both music and words, and a score below 0.33 means the song does not have any speech)
•	valence - A measure of how happy or sad the song sounds
•	tempo - Beats per minute


<Data Analysis and Visualisation>
The data analysis and data visualisation were performed using Python and its following 3 libraries:
1.	Pandas
2.	Matplotlib
3.	Seaborn

The Python files for conducted data analysis are in the "Python Codes" folder as follows:
A) Popularity Distribution of Albums [ Pie-Chart ] 
B) Top 5 Popular Songs [ Bar Plot ]
C) Album Songs Released Over the Years
D) Album Classification based on their Duration
E) Additional Albums’ Statistics [ Violin Plot ]
 

<Compilation of All Data Visuals>
I compiled and edited the final infographic in my mobile phone using the android application PixelLab.
